# SniffR | Mobile Air Quality Sensor Device

This project is for the software side of development for my custom Air Quality Monitoring Device.
My passion for this project is driven by the yearly smoke layer released in the summer by major forest fires in the PNW.
This device follows these set of rules:
```
1. Must be power-efficient
2. Must be compact
3. Must be non-technical user-friendly
4. Must be cost-effective
5. Must be fully open-source
```
