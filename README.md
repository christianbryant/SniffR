# SniffR | Mobile Air Quality Sensor Device

**SniffR** is an open-source mobile air quality monitoring device designed to track real-time air quality conditions in your immediate environment. This project focuses on developing the software stack for SniffR, with the goal of making air quality monitoring **accessible**, **affordable**, and **user-friendly**—especially important during the wildfire seasons in the Pacific Northwest.  

This device will be showcased at **Teardown PDX 2025**.
